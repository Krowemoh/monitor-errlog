Universe Errlog Monitor

This is an extended version of the monitor described at https://harvestersvault.com/?p=132

This version can use a list of keywords hardcoded in the script, it can read from a list of watch words from a file and it can trigger an e-mail if the errlog changes. 

I currently use a list of hardcoded changes as that was the original design and the extensions for other people.

Thanks
