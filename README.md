# monitor-errlog
Universe Errlog Monitor

This version can use a list of keywords hardcoded in the script, it can read from a list of watch words from a file and it can trigger an e-mail if the errlog changes. 

I currently use a list of hardcoded changes as that was the original design and the extensions for other people.

You should be able to add this script to the cron and just have it run.

Thanks
